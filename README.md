This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by David Bowie: Hallo Spaceboy. When activated you will randomly see a lyric from &lt;cite>Hallo Spaceboy&lt;/cite> in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
